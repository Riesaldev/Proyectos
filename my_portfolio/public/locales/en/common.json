        "title": "About me",
        "content": "I am a web developer passionate about technology, design and interactive storytelling. My vocation is to create unique experiences that are not only functional, but also visually striking and emotionally meaningful. Although my work experience began in 2004, it was in 2018 when I started a path of training in 3D modeling, specializing in tools like Blender, ZBrush and 3ds Max. I studied as a Higher Technician in Sculpture, but due to unexpected turns in life, I ended up dedicating myself to construction as a welder and assembler of metal structures. However, that stage led me to rethink my course. I decided to make a 180-degree turn and refocus my future on what I'm really passionate about: technology and creativity. In 2024 I trained as a full stack web developer through an intensive bootcamp, complementing my learning with certifications in JavaScript and CSS frameworks, TypeScript, and agile methodologies like Scrum. Today I merge all that experience to build projects that tell stories, awaken emotions and bring ideas to life. Although my professional experience in web development is recent, my passion for technology and design is long-standing and I supplement with my dedication and creativity what I lack in years of experience. I also bring my previous experience in the field of construction, hospitality (12 years in positions of responsibility in kitchen and events; from working at the World Travel Market in London to being section manager in 5-star luxury hotels or learning from Michelin stars and working with them) and even in the Spanish Army, where I learned discipline, teamwork and leadership. All of this has allowed me to develop a resilient mindset and an ability to adapt that I consider essential in the world of web development."

Her presence radiates calm and power and is formed by the same essence of the lake. With a gentle gesture, the Lady of the Lake invites them to approach, and the Wizard feels that the time has come to reveal his purpose: to find the Sword of Destiny. The Lady of the Lake nods, understanding the importance of their mission and reveals the <strong>location of the sword</strong>. It is the Fairies, in their plane, who protect and guard The Sword of Destiny. They are getting closer and closer."
